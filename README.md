Full course description
Knowledge graphs are large-scale, machine-processable representations of entities, their attributes, and their relationships. Knowledge graphs enable both people and machines to explore, understand, and reuse information in a wide variety of applications such as answering questions, finding relevant content, understanding social structures, and making scientific discoveries. However, the sheer size and complexity of these graphs present a formidable challenge particularly when mining across different topic areas.

In this course, we will examine approaches to construct and use knowledge graphs across a diverse set of applications using cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning and deep learning, graph databases, ontologies and automated reasoning, and other relevant techniques in the area of data mining and knowledge representation.

Prerequisites
