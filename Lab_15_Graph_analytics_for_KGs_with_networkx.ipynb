        "\n",
        "[NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9/index.html) is a Python software package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and function of complex networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notebook description:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a notebook which demonstrates the basic features for constructing and analysing networks using the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) Python package.\n",
        "\n",
        "* We will introduce basic NetworkX features required for constructing simple networks from scratch by creating the individual nodes and edges in the network \"by hand\".\n",
        "* We will then demonstrate some common network analysis tasks that one can apply to the network to describe some of its characteristics. These characteristics can be either global or local in scope:\n",
        "    * global characteristics: pertain to the network as a whole\n",
        "    * local characteristics: pertain to parts of the network, such as:\n",
        "        * a subset of the nodes and edges within the full network (a subnetwork),\n",
        "        * individual nodes, or\n",
        "        * individual edges\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important considerations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* NetworkX is designed mainly for constructing and analysing networks. Although it does provide rudimentary visualisation capabilities for small networks (up to hundreds of nodes), visualisation is not a main function of the library and therefore its performance and capabilities are quite limited w.r.t. visualisation. However, networks constructed with NetworkX can be saved and imported downstream into more powerful network visualisation platforms e.g. [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/)\n",
        "* In this tutorial we generally use the terms \"graph\" and \"network\" interchangeably\n",
        "\n",
        "**Useful reading:**\n",
        "* Textbook on Network Science by [Albert-László Barabási](https://barabasi.com/): **[link](http://networksciencebook.com/)**\n",
